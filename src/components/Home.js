				<h1>What is the Civil Service Exam Philippines</h1>
				<p>The career service examination is the governmentâ€™s way of screening and selecting prospective civil servants in the country. The Civil Service Commission (CSC) creates and administers this exam to determine which applicants are fit for a government job.</p>
				<h1>Types of Civil Service Exams in the Philippines</h1>
				
				<li>Professional</li>
				<li>Sub-Professional</li>
				
				<p>Passers of the exam for professional civil service level may be accepted for both clerical (first-level) and technical, executive, or managerial (second-level) positions in the government.
				On the other hand, passers of the exam for the sub-professional civil service level may be accepted only for first-level or clerical government positions.</p>

				<h1>Modes of Civil Service Exam</h1>
				<p>You can take the exam through the manual pen-and-paper test (PPT) or the computerized examination (COMEX).
				With the PPT, you take the test using a text booklet and an answer sheet. The COMEX, on the other hand, is conducted online.</p>
